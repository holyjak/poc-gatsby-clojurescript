Terminal:

    # compile and watch
    shadow-cljs watch app

    # connect to REPL for the build (available while watch is running)
    shadow-cljs cljs-repl app


IntelliJ:

> Run `npx shadow-cljs server` inside the Terminal provided by IntelliJ and use Clojure REPL â†’ Remote Run Configuration to connect to the provided nREPL server (its port in the output and in target/shadow-cljs/nrepl.port).

Emacs: see https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#cider

Tip:

> If the popular cider-nrepl is found on the classpath it will be added automatically. No additional configuration required.

### Start build, cljs REPL from the Shadow server repl:

(After having started `npx shadow-cljs server`.)

```clj
(shadow/watch :the-build)
(shadow/nrepl-select :the-build) ; this starts cljs repl
```
